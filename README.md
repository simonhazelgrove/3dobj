# 3dobj

Aim

Display simple 3D objects in a WebGL element.  I want to be able to display objects reminiscent of late 80's / early 90's flight sim vehicles - e.g. flat shading, no textures.  Not interested in texture mapping.  I want to make use of modern resolutions though - so no pixellated displays.  Also 50% sure I want to ignore colour palette limitations, so things like lighting will be ok.
